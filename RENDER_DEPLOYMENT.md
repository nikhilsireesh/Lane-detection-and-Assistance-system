## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Build Fails**
- Check logs in Render dashboard
- Verify all files are in GitHub repository

**2. App Won't Start**
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify the start command in render.yaml
- Check deployment logs for detailed error messages

**3. Camera Not Working**
- Camera access is limited on web deployments
- Use image/video upload instead for production

**4. Slow Loading**
- First load may take 30-60 seconds (free tier)
- Subsequent loads will be faster

**5. Model Status Shows "Error"**
- This is **normal** for cloud deployments on free tier
- System automatically activates demo mode
- All UI features remain fully functional
- Users can still upload and test the interface

**6. "Model was not loaded" Message**
- Expected behavior when model files are too large for cloud storage
- Demo mode provides simulated results for testing
- Core system architecture and UI work perfectly

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Free Tier Limitations**: 
   - App sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - 750 hours/month limit

2. **Performance**: 
   - First request may be slow (cold start)
   - Consider upgrading to paid plan for production use

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Check logs in Render dashboard
   - Monitor performance metrics
